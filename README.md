# MKIT
For Linux And Termux ( maybe )

# Info 
MKIT is a metasploit-inspired tool that I made simply, using a custom payload and equipped with an installer tool.

This tool is still in BETA, so there aren't too many payloads and tools, so I'm sorry

# Install
This is the way to clone the MKIT repository
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/MsecTeam/MKIT
  $ cd MKIT
  ```
Initial installation, you have to run install.py in this way
  ```
  $ sudo python3 install.py
  ```
Now for Termux you can remove the sudo command, so it will be like this

  ```
  $ python3 install.py
  ```
  
And yes, you can run the tools

Happy Use :)
