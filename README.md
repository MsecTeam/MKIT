# MKIT
For Linux And Termux ( maybe )

# Info 
MKIT is a metasploit-inspired tool that I made simply, using a custom payload and equipped with an installer tool.

This tool is still in BETA, so there aren't too many payloads and tools, so I'm sorry

# Install

  ```
  $ sudo python3 install.py
  ```
